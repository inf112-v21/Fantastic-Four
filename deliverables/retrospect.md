#Retrospective view on the project performance

Summary: All in all a good team experience where all team members contributed well on their respective areas.


### MOM's, communication, and Kanban project board 
As this project-based programming assignment was quite a new experience for the team, a structured, well-thought-out
plan for the administrative process was not fully developed before the team had been working for a week already.
For instance, a blueprint format for the MOM's was not proposed until the third team meeting (mom_08_02_21.md),
and also the decision to write everything in English were taken in this same meeting.

Mainly meetings on 

Kanban worked excellent.



### Team description and distribution of roles
During the first team meeting, the team members were given specific roles based on a hunch of what could benefit
the team:
- Team Lead and Customer Contact - Morten
- Test Responsible - Daniel
- UI Design Lead - Edyta
- Mechanics/Tech Lead - Mathias

This division were shown to be quite accurate, however as the project evolved, and as the team members embarked various
tasks that needed attention, a natural distribution of roles were solidifying. Morten had taken most of the
responsibility for testing and writing code, while Daniel had taken on most of the administrative tasks that were
pressing. Edyta showed excellent spirit in developing user interfaces for the various game menus, which will be an
important part of the next assignments. Last but not least, Mathias has done good research on the workings of
the libGDX application (including how to implement screens, and come up with a strategy for making the game
object-oriented); in other words, facilitated further development of RoboRally for the coming assignments.

The roles for this assignment turned out to be:
- Team Lead and Customer Contact - Daniel
- Code & Test Responsible - Morten
- UI Design Lead - Edyta
- Mechanics/Tech Lead - Mathias

#Suggestions from team members:
Thoughts on what went well and what could be improved?
## Subproblem 1: Organizing the team
- Originally Daniel was intended to be the test lead, and Morten was intended to be the team leader. But a reversal of
  those roles came naturally and were changed.
- Even in a small team, a division of responsibility is a good technique for securing progress.

## Subproblem 2: Specify a process for the team (thoughts on MOM's, communication and Kanban project board)
- Minutes of meetings are valuable for logging what was discussed and deciding further actions.
- The method of using smaller tasks and sprints on a project board was motivational.
- A project board story that involved two test classes proved to big, as one of the classes (`MapTest`) was difficult to automate.
  So even smaller stories are recommended.

## Subproblem 3: Overview of expected product (user stories, AC, solutions)
- User stories and acceptance criteria were (and still are) a new concept for us, and proved harder to do than expected.
- Also, user stories might be even harder to write for an existing game with strict rules. Especially the value added
  part felt backwards as they could probably all just be "because the rules say so"

## Subproblem 4: Code (thoughts?)
- The code part of this first sprint was small and mostly achieved through the libGDX and Tiled tutorial.
- There are several classes in the project that are empty, but intended to use for abstraction and modulation as the
  project progresses.
