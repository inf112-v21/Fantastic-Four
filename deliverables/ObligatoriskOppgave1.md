## Subproblem 3

### Shot description of the overall motivation for the application
The application will allow one or more players to play a digital version of the board game RoboRally.
It must be possible to play single player (against AI) and multiplayer (over the internet). Players will be guided by
the application to perform legal moves without the player having to know all the rule details. The board, pieces, 
and cards etc, should be displayed for the player by the application.
The application will do quite a lot of operations without help of the users, including moving the players' pieces,
inflicting damage, keeping track of the move priority order, as well as shuffling and dealing out cards for the players.

### List of user stories for the system based on the MVP-requirements

- as a player I wish to win by visiting a flag to finish the game
- as a player I wish to play multiplayer to increase the joy of playing
- as a player I wish to be able to start a multiplayer game to invite friends
- as a player I wish that cards are dealt so that I can play
- as a player I wish to choose 5 cards of those I am dealt, so that the game can proceed
- as a player I wish that my chosen cards will move my robot so that I can compete in the game

### List of user stories related to the game menu
- as a player I wish that when I start the game, I will see a game menu right away, so that I can decide which
  board I would like to play
- as a player I wish that when I start the game, a game instruction will appear, so that I can learn the game.
- as a player I wish that when I start the game, I will have access to game settings right away, so that I 
  can adjust sound, image, appearance, language, etc

  continue or stop playing

### Brukerhistorier til Program Sheet
- as a player I need a Program Sheet so that I have an overview of the game status (ice berg)
  - as a player I need å se kortene mine foran meg, slik at jeg har kontroll på hvilke trekk roboten
    min kommer til å foreta seg
  - as a player I need å se hvor mange Damge tokens roboten min har fått, slik at jeg kan ta overveide
    strategiske valg
  - as a player I need å se hvor mange Life tokens (gjenværende liv) jeg har igjen, slik at jeg har oversikt over
    spillsituasjonen min
  - as a player I need en visuell bekreftelse på om jeg har aktiv Power Down status for neste runde eller ikke

  - as a player I need å se hvor mye tid det er igjen på å organisere programkortene, slik at kortene ikke blir
    plassert tilfeldig i "registerne"


### Akseptansekriterier og arbeidsoppgaver til brukerhistoriene
-For hver brukerhistorie, skal dere ha akseptansekriterier og arbeidsoppgaver, 
samt beskrivelse av hvilke krav brukerhistorien oppfyller (dette lager dere kun 
for historier dere er ferdige med, holder på med, eller skal til å begynne med)_

### Prioritert liste over brukerhistorier til første iterasjon
-En prioritert liste over hvilke brukerhistorier dere vil ha med i første iterasjon 
(altså frem til levering av denne oppgaven, se Subproblem 4 for forslag)_

## Subproblem 4
-Vi forventer at dere skriver brukerhistorier (husk å få med hvilke krav brukerhistoriene dekker i beskrivelse)og kode
for punkt 1 til 5 ved denne innleveringen_
