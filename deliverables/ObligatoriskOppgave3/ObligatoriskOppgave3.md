# Mandatory Assignment 3


## Subproblem 1: Team and project

### Project board screen shot

- The team roles work good, they have solidified over the past weeks of working together
-
- Retrospect:
  - We wanted to do improve on what we discussed in last delivery's retrospect, so we had a physical meeting early on
    such that every team member got a common view and understanding of how the different parts of the project and codes
    would be combined into a working RoboRally game
  - We experienced that we gained a lot from meting physically; we all got a clearer overview of the architecture of
    the project, and we even made some important adjustments in our code that made it easier for us to carry out the
    teamwork ahead
  - however, pandemic restrictions made it so that we were only able to meet up once
- Improvements for next time:
  - If possible, we would like to physically meet up at least once for the next sprint of the project, as we saw that
    this helped us immensely
  - 
- The prioritized tasks for the next sprint are:
  - making the multiplayer part of the game work (focus on the classes RoboRallyClient
  and RoboRallyServer)
  - implementing the game loop into the RoboGame class
  - creating a GameLogic class for taking care of the rules of the game and the logic behind movements etc.
- The group dynamic works good, probably as a result of the natural division of tasks among the team members
- Communication is good, as we all try to respect the others work, and the fact that we have different technical
  approaches when it comes to programming

### Explanation of difference in number of commits
At first glance there is a big difference in the number of commits between the team members.
If one also looks at the number of lines changed, the difference is a lot less.

#### The main reasons for this are:
- Morten and Daniel have written most of the MOMs and other text files, this gives more commits
- Edyta and Mathias has written bigger chunks of code that has been waiting for earlier code to be finished,
  and their big changes were commited at once, giving fewer commits.
- Morten has refactored several files, changed data type for a lot of field variables and has removed
  unused code. Each file should have a separate commit, giving more commits
- Morten has "hosted" pair programming sessions, giving more commits

Overall, everybody has contributed as evenly to the project as could be expected.

By looking at the number of lines added, removed and the number of commits, the picture is more even.
as seen
in the below screenshots (at the time of writing, Mathias' big change is not commited/merged).
